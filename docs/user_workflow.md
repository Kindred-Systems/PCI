# üìñ Developer Documentation: PCI Project Management Workflow

## üß† **Overview**
The PCI platform implements an intuitive, AI-augmented project management workflow designed for high efficiency and user-guided control. This workflow draws inspiration from Langflow's interface, utilizing a **node-based visual UI** to manage tasks, dependencies, and deliverables with minimal friction.

## üöÄ **High-Level Workflow Description**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Project Initialization**
- Users initiate a new project via the **+ Create Project/Task** button in the **Project Explorer**.
- This action triggers a **prompt window component** modeled after Langflow's **Browser UI**.
- The prompt window captures essential project details such as:
  - **Project Name**
  - **Project Type** *(Engineering, Design, Development, etc.)*
  - **Project Description**
  - **AI Guidance Level** *(Manual vs. Autonomous control)*
  - **Initial Parameters** *(dynamic fields tailored to the project's domain)*
- Upon form submission, the platform generates a **Project Node** within the graph interface.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **AI-Guided Solution Discovery**
- After project initialization, the right-hand panel displays **AI-generated solution suggestions**.
- These suggestions encompass various solution types:
  - **New Solutions** *(created from scratch)*
  - **Branched Solutions** *(forked from existing assets)*
  - **Updated Solutions** *(modifications to established deliverables)*
- Users can interact with these suggestions by:
  - **Expanding Cards**: Access detailed insights into solution rationale, feasibility scores, and AI confidence metrics.
  - **Manual Input**: Adjust parameters to refine the AI's suggestions.
  - **Selection**: Choose the preferred solution to advance project execution.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Project Task Decomposition**
- Once a solution is selected, the platform employs its **AI-driven task decomposition engine** to break down the solution into actionable tasks.
- Tasks appear as **interconnected nodes** within the **visual graph UI**, with **dependencies mapped** accordingly.
- Users retain control over the task structure through:
  - **Manual Task Addition**: Create new tasks using the **+ Task** button.
  - **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Adjust the task execution sequence.
  - **Dependency Management**: Define task dependencies by connecting or disconnecting node edges.
  - **Deliverable Assignment**: Attach engineering files (e.g., PDFs, CAD drawings) as task deliverables.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Task Execution & Monitoring**
- Users can **execute tasks** directly from the **graph interface**.
- Each task node contains real-time status indicators:
  - **Pending**: Task is defined but not yet started.
  - **Running**: Task is actively being executed.
  - **Completed**: Task finished successfully.
  - **Failed**: Task terminated with errors.
- Control options:
  - **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run**
  - **‚è∏ Pause**
  - **‚èπ Stop**
- A **log window** at the bottom of the interface provides **live execution feedback** via a **terminal-like UI**.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Deliverable Generation & Review**
- Upon task completion, **engineering deliverables** are generated automatically.
- Deliverables are displayed as **linked assets** within the corresponding task node.
- Key features:
  - **Inline Preview**: Open deliverables directly in the browser if compatible.
  - **Download & Share**: Access files via secure download links.
  - **Audit Trail**: Each deliverable includes **timestamped logs** detailing its creation process.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Project Closure & Reporting**
- After completing all tasks, the platform generates a **comprehensive project summary**.
- The summary includes:
  - **Task Execution Overview** *(duration, outcomes, performance metrics)*
  - **Deliverable Index** *(links to final files)*
  - **System Insights** *(AI-suggested process improvements)*
- Users can then:
  - **Archive the Project** *(for record-keeping)*
  - **Clone the Project** *(for similar future work)*
